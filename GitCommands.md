If you intend to incorporate changes from the master branch into your current branch, you can execute the following commands:

      git checkout {branch_name}
      git stash
      git rebase master
      git stash list
      git stash apply $stash_hash

**Tip:** Prior to rebasing, it is advisable to commit your changes. Committing is a safer approach compared to stashing, as there is a risk of losing your stash during the rebase process (which is why the last two commands were utilized).
